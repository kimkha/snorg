Requires: Elgg 1.5 or higher

The event_calendar plugin adds a site-wide event calendar as well as
an event calendar to each group. Various options related to the site and group
calendars can be set using the event calendaer settings on the tool
administration page.

Group members can view events by month, week and day using a jQuery date 
picker widget, and submit event descriptions including the venue, start date,
end date, tags, description, organiser, contact person, event access level, 
and fees if any.

Group events are aggregrated into the site wide event calendar accessible from
the Tools menu drop down.

Site admins (or optionally any user) can also add non-group-specific events to 
the site-wide calendar.

Users can add group or site-wide events to a personal calendar to showcase
events that they plan to attend or are interested in. They can optionally 
display these events by dragging an Event calendar widget onto their profile
or dashboard.

The number of users who have added an event to their personal gallery is listed
on each event page along with a link to a page that displays these users in a 
gallery format. It is thus easy to find other people interested in the same
event.

The development of the event calendar plugin was funded by the Research
& Development department at the Royal Institute of British Architects
(RIBA).
