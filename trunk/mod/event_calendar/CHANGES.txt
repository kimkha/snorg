CHANGE LOG

0.5

Initial release

0.51 

Fixed event overlap detection

0.6

Fixed a bug that prevented more than one person adding a given event to
his/her personal calendar.

Fixed a bug that made the page owner the person who created the event. This
is now the group for group events, otherwise the currently logged in user.

Added river support.

0.7

Reworked design for Elgg 1.5

Fixed several bugs, including in the list of people who added an event to 
their personal calendar (now shows the proper group navigation if this is 
a group event).

Added the ability to view all/friends/mine events for logged-in users.

Added numerous configuration options (accessible via event_calendar settings
on the admin tools configuration page). This allows, for example, any logged-in
user to add events to the site calendar, to remove group calendars, etc.

People who create an event now have the event automatically added to their
personal event calendar. This behaviour can be configured via the admin event
calendar settings.
